    Chrome Key Bioinformatics is a solo consulting practice specializing in
    signal-noise separation for complex genomic data.

    Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a computational biologist who loves turning messy data into
    clear insights.
  </p>
  <p>
    My fascination with separating signal from noise started during my PhD at
    the University of Pennsylvania, where I developed <span
      class="greenscreen-highlight">greenscreen</span
    >—a method for filtering artifacts from ChIP-seq data. The idea was simple
    but powerful: use existing tools creatively to remove the background
    obscuring your biological signal.
  </p>

  <p>
    That philosophy shaped everything that followed. During my postdoc at
    Pfizer, I tackled complex datasets in internal medicine and rare disease
    research, always asking: what's real biology and what's technical noise?
    Before that, I worked at the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute,
    and now I bring all that experience to clients as an independent contractor.
  </p>

  <p>
    I founded Chrome Key Bioinformatics because I believe the best insights come
    from asking better questions—and from knowing what <em>not</em> to look at. Every
    dataset has a story, but you have to filter out the background first.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not analyzing data, I'm probably running through Cambridge or doing
    web development for Boston Women in Bioinformatics.. Let's work together to
    find the signal in your data.
